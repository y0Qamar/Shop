By the grace of G*d, you will absorb an dmove this through like a champ before the week is out.

Your weekend assignment is to build Targé where users can shop designer on a budget :joy:
This program should allow us to manage inventory at a shop.
You'll need to define three classes: Product, Shop and Main
Product should define the data model for a Product at Targé
Shop should manage a list of all the Product objects created  for Targé
Main should run our program and start a loop that prints:
Welcome to Targjay, CRUD,QUit

Level 1: Working with multiple classes and instance methods
When the user chooses to create a new product your
Shop should ask them for all the necessary information you need to create a
new product and add it to your list.
When the user chooses to read all the products your S
hop should print all the products in the list in a well formatted way.

todo: l1/2
scaffolding of methods first
1) create product data class: add product variables price, ID, in stock, aisle, print prodcut
 2) shop: shop data class: add product to store, remove product from store, print inventory.
 3)  main: Crud loop, calling all methods


Level 2: Adding logic for finding and modifying objects in an ArrayList
When the user chooses to update a product, your Shop should ask them which
 product  ID they want to update and ask them to input the necessary information to update that product.
When the user chooses to remove a product your Shop should ask
them which product ID they want to remove and should remove the product.


Level 3: Extending Main Loop Logic
Make a separate class for a Shopper and add functionality to your loop in
 Main to ask whether a user would
like to run the program as a Shopper or a Manager when it first runs
and if they're a Manager, present them the loop we built initially otherwise present them another loop that prints a list of available products:
